# Disney Characters App

This is a simple Vue.js application designed to showcase basic Vue.js functionalities like:

- **Component-based architecture:** Separating UI into reusable components
- **Data binding:** Connecting data to the UI for dynamic updates
- **Computed properties:** Calculating derived data for efficiency
- **Fetching data from an API:** Using `fetch` to get external data
- **Styling with CSS:** Implementing basic styling for a visually appealing UI
- **Basic user interaction:** Sorting characters based on different criteria
- **Search functionality:** Filtering characters by name

## Theme:

This project is a playful exploration of the vast universe of Disney characters. It allows users to browse, sort, and search a list of characters based on their appearance in different Disney films, short films, TV shows, and video games.

## Technologies:

- **Vue.js:** The primary framework for the application
- **HTML:** Structure of the web page
- **CSS:** Styling and design
- **JavaScript:** For application logic and interaction

## Getting started:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/sligius/web-development`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd web-development`
3. **Checkout the `main` branch:** `git checkout main`
4. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd hw_5` 
5. **Install dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install`
6. **Run the development server:** `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`

## Instructions:

- Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` 
- You will see a list of Disney characters. 
- Use the sorting options to arrange the characters by name or by the number of their appearances in various Disney productions. 
- **Enter a character name in the search bar to filter the results.** 

## Note:

The application uses the Disney API (https://api.disneyapi.dev/) to fetch character data. The API may be subject to changes or limitations.

## Possible improvements:

- **More sorting options:** Include sorting by character type (e.g., prince, princess, villain) or by first appearance.
- **Advanced search:** Implement more complex search functionality, such as searching by character traits or by appearances in specific media.
- **Image loading:** Implement better image loading and error handling for unavailable images.
- **Advanced styling:** Use more advanced CSS techniques for a more polished look.
- **Responsive design:** Make the application work well on different screen sizes.
